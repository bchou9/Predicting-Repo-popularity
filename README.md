# Predicting-Repo-popularity

<img src="media/sample.gif" width="900" height="430" />

Machine learning model that can predict the popularity of GitHub repository just by giving your repo URL in the input. Here, popularity means the number of stars âœ¨ it can get in the future. So, for data we use scripts to scrap data from github.

Folder `Notebooks` contains data files and script to extract data. We have used github api and kaggle github dataset and the file `kaggle_data.csv` and `github_api.csv`  contains all the combine data of repositories which has columns `repo_name`, `star`, `fork`, `watch`, `issue`, `tags`, `most_used_lang`, `discription`, `contributors`, `license`, and `repo_url`.

data_extraction.ipynb file contains script to extract repositories data, analysis.ipynb file contains cleaning and visualization operations on the dataset. model.ipynb building a machine learning model that can predict which repositories will gain how much `stars` in the future. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Run on Local System

* Create an virual environment:
```
python -m venv "evironment_name"
```
For more details follow [this](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

* Activate the Environment:
  - For Windows:
     > .\"evironment_name"\Scripts\activate

  - For Mac or Linux:
    > source "evironment_name"/bin/activate


* Install all the dependencies using : 
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

*  Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pcsingh/Predicting-Repo-popularity.git
```
* Open the project directory:
```
cd Predicting-Repo-popularity
```


1. To extract the  github repo data using github api run [data_extraction.ipynb](https://github.com/pcsingh/Predicting-Repo-popularity/blob/master/Notebooks/data_extraction.ipynb) notebook.<br>
Github has the limits on the accessing the github api , so you need to use your github token inorder to extract data . One can generate their github token from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

Github api requires headers for authorization.<br>

```
header={'Accept':'application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json',
'visibility':'PUBLIC',
"Authorization": "token PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"
} 
```

2. To visualize some insight of the dataset run [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/pcsingh/Predicting-Repo-popularity/blob/master/Notebooks/analysis.ipynb)

3. For training model to make prediction of repo popularity run [model.ipynb](https://github.com/pcsingh/Predicting-Repo-popularity/blob/master/Notebooks/model.ipynb) , we have used multiple regressions model , but one with the best R2 score is used for making prediction.<br><br>
* Run streamlit inorder to make prediction using trained model:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
**Note: Put the github token in the model.ipynb notebook and app.py to make prediction.**
