# Predicting-Repo-popularity
Machine model that can predict the popularity of GitHub repository using it's title and some other stuffs as input. Here, popularity means the number of stars âœ¨ it can get. So, for data we are using kaggle from where we combine various data sets.

Then we will clean it and do some analysis to get insights according to that we will do featuring engineering and build model. Number of stars is a continuous variable so for building model we will use a ` supervised regression` algorithms.

Let's start :smile:
